# 17 - ACTING SIMPLY



True leaders  
are hardly known to their followers.  
Next after them are the leaders  
the people know and admire;  
after them, those they fear;  
after them, those they despise.  

To give no trust  
is to get no trust.  

When the work’s done right,  
with no fuss or boasting,  
ordinary people say,  
Oh, we did it.  


> **Note** UKLG: This invisible leader, who gets things done in such a way that people think they did it all themselves, isn’t one who manipulates others from behind the scenes; just the opposite. Again, it’s a matter of “doing without doing”: uncompetitive, unworried, trustful accomplishment, power that is not force. An example or analogy might be a very good teacher, or the truest voice in a group of singers.
