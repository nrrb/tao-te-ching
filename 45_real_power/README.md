# 45 - REAL POWER



What’s perfectly whole seems flawed,  
but you can use it forever.  
What’s perfectly full seems empty,  
but you can’t use it up.  

True straightness looks crooked.  
Great skill looks clumsy.  
Real eloquence seems to stammer.  

To be comfortable in the cold, keep moving;  
to be comfortable in the heat, hold still;  
to be comfortable in the world, stay calm and clear.
