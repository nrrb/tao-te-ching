# 46 - WANTING LESS



When the world’s on the Way,  
they use horses to haul manure.  
When the world gets off the Way,  
they breed warhorses on the common.  

The greatest evil: wanting more.  
The worst luck: discontent.  
Greed’s the curse of life.  

To know enough’s enough  
is enough to know.
