# 13 - SHAMELESS



To be in favor or disgrace  
is to live in fear.  
To take the body seriously  
is to admit one can suffer.  

What does that mean,  
to be in favor or disgrace  
is to live in fear?  
Favor debases:  
we fear to lose it,  
fear to win it.  
So to be in favor or disgrace  
is to live in fear.  

What does that mean,  
to take the body seriously  
is to admit one can suffer?  
I suffer because I’m a body;  
if I weren’t a body,  
how could I suffer?  

So people who set their bodily good  
before the public good  
could be entrusted with the commonwealth,  
and people who treated the body politic  
as gently as their own body  
would be worthy to govern the commonwealth.  


> **Note** UKLG: Lao Tzu, a mystic, demystifies political power.  
    Autocracy and oligarchy foster the beliefs that power is gained magically and retained by sacrifice, and that powerful people are genuinely superior to the powerless.  
    Lao Tzu does not see political power as magic. He sees rightful power as earned and wrongful power as usurped. He does not see power as virtue, but as the result of virtue. The democracies are founded on that view. 
    He sees sacrifice of self or others as a corruption of power, and power as available to anybody who follows the Way. This is a radically subversive attitude. No wonder anarchists and Taoists make good friends.
