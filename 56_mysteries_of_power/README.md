# 56 - MYSTERIES OF POWER



Who knows  
doesn’t talk.  
Who talks  
doesn’t know.  
Closing the openings,  
shutting doors,  

blunting edge,  
loosing bond,  
dimming light,  
be one with the dust of the way.  
So you come to the deep sameness.  

Then you can’t be controlled by love  
or by rejection.  
You can’t be controlled by profit  
or by loss.  
You can’t be controlled by praise  
or by humiliation.  
Then you have honor under heaven.
