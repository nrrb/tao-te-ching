# 31 - AGAINST WAR



Even the best weapon  
is an unhappy tool,  
hateful to living things.  
So the follower of the Way  
stays away from it.  

Weapons are unhappy tools,  
not chosen by thoughtful people,  
to be used only when there is no choice,  
and with a calm, still mind,  
without enjoyment.  
To enjoy using weapons  
is to enjoy killing people,  
and to enjoy killing people  
is to lose your share in the common good.  

It is right that the murder of many people  
be mourned and lamented.  
It is right that a victor in war  
be received with funeral ceremonies.
