# 69 - USING MYSTERY



The expert in warfare says:  
Rather than dare make the attack  
I’d take the attack;  
rather than dare advance an inch  
I’d retreat a foot.  

It’s called marching without marching,  
rolling up your sleeves without flexing your muscles,  
being armed without weapons,  
giving the attacker no opponent.  
Nothing’s worse than attacking what yields.  
To attack what yields is to throw away the prize.  

So, when matched armies meet,  
the one who comes to grief  
is the true victor.  


> **Note** UKLG: A piece of sound tactical advice (practiced by the martial arts, such as Aikido, and by underground resistance and guerilla forces), which leads to a profound moral warning. The prize thrown away by the aggressor is compassion. The yielder, the griever, the mourner, keeps that prize. The game is loser takes all.
