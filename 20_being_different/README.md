# 20 - BEING DIFFERENT



How much difference between yes and no?  
What difference between good and bad?  

What the people fear  
must be feared.  
O desolation!  
Not yet, not yet has it reached its limit!  

Everybody’s cheerful,  
cheerful as if at a party,  
or climbing a tower in springtime.  
And here I sit unmoved,  
clueless, like a child,  
a baby too young to smile.  

Forlorn, forlorn.  
Like a homeless person.  
Most people have plenty.  
I’m the one that’s poor,  
a fool right through.  

Ignorant, ignorant.  
Most people are so bright.  
I’m the one that’s dull.  
Most people are so keen.  
I don’t have the answers.  
Oh, I’m desolate, at sea,  
adrift, without harbor.  

Everybody has something to do.  
I’m the clumsy one, out of place.  
I’m the different one,  
for my food  
is the milk of the mother.  


> **Note** UKLG:  The difference between yes and no, good and bad, is something only the “bright” people, the people with the answers, can understand. A poor stupid Taoist can’t make it out.  
    This chapter is full of words like huang (wild, barren; famine), tun (ignorant; chaotic), hun (dull, turbid), men (sad, puzzled, mute), and hu (confused, obscured, vague). They configure chaos, confusion, a “bewilderness” in which the mind wanders without certainties, desolate, silent, awkward. But in that milky, dim strangeness lies the way. It can’t be found in the superficial order imposed by positive and negative opinions, the good/bad, yes/no moralizing that denies fear and ignores mystery.
