# 41 - ON AND OFF



Thoughtful people hear about the Way  
and try hard to follow it.  
Ordinary people hear about the Way  
and wander onto it and off it.  
Thoughtless people hear about the Way  
and make jokes about it.  
It wouldn’t be the Way  
if there weren’t jokes about it.  

So they say:  
The Way’s brightness looks like darkness;  
advancing on the Way feels like retreating;  
the plain Way seems hard going.  
The height of power seems a valley;  
the amplest power seems not enough;  
the firmest power seems feeble.  
Perfect whiteness looks dirty.  
The pure and simple looks chaotic.  

The great square has no corners.  
The great vessel is never finished.  
The great tone is barely heard.  
The great thought can’t be thought.  

The Way is hidden  
in its namelessness.  
But only the Way  
begins, sustains, fulfills.
