# 16 - RETURNING TO THE ROOT



Be completely empty.  
Be perfectly serene.  
The ten thousand things arise together;  
in their arising is their return.  
Now they flower,  
and flowering  
sink homeward,  
returning to the root.  

The return to the root  
is peace.  
Peace: to accept what must be,  
to know what endures.  
In that knowledge is wisdom.  
Without it, ruin, disorder.  

To know what endures  
is to be openhearted,  
magnanimous,  
regal,  
blessed,  
following the Tao,  
the way that endures forever.  
The body comes to its ending,  
but there is nothing to fear.
