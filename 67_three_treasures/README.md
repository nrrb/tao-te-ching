# 67 - THREE TREASURES



Everybody says my way is great  
but improbable.  

All greatness  
is improbable.  
What’s probable  
is tedious and petty.  

I have three treasures.  
I keep and treasure them.  
The first, mercy,  
the second, moderation,  
the third, modesty.  
If you’re merciful you can be brave,  
if you’re moderate you can be generous,  
and if you don’t presume to lead  
you can lead the high and mighty.  

But to brave without compassion,  
or generous without self-restraint,  
or to take the lead,  
is fatal  

Compassion wins the battle  
and holds the fort;  
it is the bulwark set  
around those heaven helps.  


> **Note** UKLG: The first two verses of this chapter are a joy to me.  
    The three final verses are closely connected in thought to the next two chapters, which may be read as a single meditation on mercy, moderation, and modesty, on the use of strength, on victory and defeat.
