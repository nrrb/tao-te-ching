# 37 - OVER ALL



The Way never does anything,  
and everything gets done.  
If those in power could hold to the Way,  
the ten thousand things  
would look after themselves.  
If even so they tried to act,  
I’d quiet them with the nameless,  
the natural.  

In the unnamed, in the unshapen,  
is not wanting.  
In not wanting is stillness.  
In stillness all under heaven rests.  


> **Note** UKLG: Here the themes of not doing and not wanting, the unnamed and the unshapen, recur together in one pure legato. It is wonderful how by negatives and privatives Lao Tzu gives a sense of serene, inexhaustible fullness of being.
