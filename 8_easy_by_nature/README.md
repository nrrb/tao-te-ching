# 8 - EASY BY NATURE



True goodness  
is like water.  
Water’s good  
for everything.  
It doesn’t compete.  

It goes right  
to the low loathsome places,  
and so finds the way.  

For a house,  
the good thing is level ground.  
In thinking,  
depth is good.  
The good of giving is magnanimity;  
of speaking, honesty;  
of government, order.  
The good of work is skill,  
and of action, timing.  

No competition,  
so no blame.  


> **Note** UKLG: A clear stream of water runs through this book, from poem to poem, wearing down the indestructible, finding the way around everything that obstructs the way. Good drinking water.
