# 7 - DIM BRIGHTNESS



Heaven will last,  
earth will endure.  
How can they last so long?  
They don’t exist for themselves  
and so can go on and on.  

So wise souls  
leaving self behind  
move forward,  
and setting self aside  
stay centered.  
Why let the self go?  
To keep what the soul needs.
