# 52 - BACK TO THE BEGINNING



The beginning of everything  
is the mother of everything.  
Truly to know the mother  
is to know her children,  
and truly to know the children  
is to turn back to the mother.  
The body comes to its ending  
but there is nothing to fear.  

Close the openings,  
shut the doors,  
and to the end of life  
nothing will trouble you.  
Open the openings,  
be busy with business,  
and to the end of life  
nothing can help you.  

Insight sees the insignificant.  
Strength knows how to yield.  
Use the way’s light, return to its insight,  
and so keep from going too far.  
That’s how to practice what’s forever.
