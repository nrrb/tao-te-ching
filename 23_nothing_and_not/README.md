# 23 - NOTHING AND NOT



Nature doesn’t make long speeches.  
A whirlwind doesn’t last all morning.  
A cloudburst doesn’t last all day.  
Who makes the wind and rain?  
Heaven and earth do.  
If heaven and earth don’t go on and on,  
certainly people don’t need to.  

The people who work with Tao  
are Tao people,  
they belong to the Way.  
People who work with power  
belong to power.  
People who work with loss  
belong to what’s lost.  

Give yourself to the Way  
and you’ll be at home on the Way.  
Give yourself to power  
and you’ll be at home in power.  
Give yourself to loss  
and when you’re lost you’ll be at home.  

To give no trust  
is to get no trust.
