# 35 - HUMANE POWER



Hold fast to the great thought  
and all the world will come to you,  
harmless, peaceable, serene.  

Walking around, we stop  
for music, for food.  
But if you taste the Way  
it’s flat, insipid.  
It looks like nothing much,  
it sounds like nothing much.  
And yet you can’t get enough of it.
