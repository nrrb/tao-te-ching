# 47 - LOOKING FAR



You don’t have to go out the door  
to know what goes on in the world.  
You don’t have to look out the window  
to see the way of heaven.  
The farther you go,  
the less you know.  

So the wise soul  
doesn’t go, but knows;  
doesn’t look, but sees;  
doesn’t do, but gets it done.  


> **Note** UKLG: We tend to expect great things from “seeing the world” and “getting experience.” A Roman poet remarked that travelers change their sky but not their soul. Other poets, untraveled and inexperienced, Emily Bronte and Emily Dickinson, prove Lao Tzu’s point: it’s the inner eye that really sees the world.
